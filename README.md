# Color Switch Game Clone

A replica of the popular Color Switch game built using Unity and C# as part of a game development bootcamp. This project showcases the fundamentals of game development, including collision detection, color-based interactions, and simple game mechanics. Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts were applied to structure the game's entities and logic.

## Features
- **Color Matching Mechanics:** The player can only pass through obstacles that match their current color.
- **Endless Mode:** The game continues until the player hits an obstacle of the wrong color.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the player’s score as they successfully pass through obstacles.
- **Simple, Addictive Gameplay:** Designed to mimic the core gameplay of the original Color Switch game.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Used to structure game logic and entity behavior.

## Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/infangle/colorswitch-replica.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity:
    - Open Unity Hub and click on "Open Project."
    - Select the cloned project folder and open it in Unity.
3. Press the **Play** button in Unity to run the game in the editor or build the game for your platform (PC, Mac, etc.).

## Gameplay Instructions
1. The player controls a ball that changes color periodically.
2. Tap or click to make the ball jump upward.
3. The goal is to pass through the obstacles that match the ball’s current color.
4. If the ball hits an obstacle of a different color, the game is over.
5. The player's score increases with every successful pass through an obstacle.

## OOP Principles Applied
- **Encapsulation:** Player, obstacles, and game mechanics are encapsulated into separate classes for better modularity.
- **Abstraction:** Complex interactions like color switching and collision handling are hidden behind simple interfaces.
- **Basic Inheritance:** Shared properties between different game entities like obstacles and UI elements are handled through base classes.

## Future Improvements
- Add more obstacle variations for increased difficulty.
- Implement power-ups and additional game modes.
- Add visual effects and sound to enhance the gameplay experience.
- Improve the game's UI and include a leaderboard.
